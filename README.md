# Airlines_Reservation_System
In the modern world, airlines are just another means of travel. We book flights, make the journey, enjoy our time and return home. But the core proceedings of the process are often neglected. The flight booking step itself contains a lot of hidden checkpoints. This project, “Airlines Booking System” aims to highlight the end to end workings of this process and to display the complexity of the system. This knowledge when imbued in individuals, will give them appreciation as well as understanding of the workings of simple commonplace things that are usually taken for granted.
